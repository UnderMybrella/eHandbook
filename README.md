# eHandbook
eHandbook is a helper application for Danganronpa Trials - both simulated and ingame. 
The applications provides a simple interface, allowing the addition, deletion and selection of:
  truth bullets
  testimonies
  evidence points.

In addition, a mapping interface is provided, allowing truth bullets to be bound to a location they were found. 
Maps for Danganronpa 1 and 2 are both provided.

# Usage
Coming soon

# Compiling
If you want to compile and work on this yourself, feel free! eHandbook is published 
under the WTFPL license (Basically, do whatever you want with it). Note however,
both the gson and Lanterna libraries are required to make this work, which can be found here:
https://github.com/google/gson

In addition, my primarily library Omnis is required, which can be found here:
